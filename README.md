# üêÆ Cows and bulls üêÆ
[Cows and bulls game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows) written using **C++** &amp; **[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)**

üéì This project was developed as a **university coursework**. 

_All code comments are written in Russian, because my teachers, unfortunately, do not know English :D_

‚ú® The design was inspired by [this](https://github.com/pavermakov/bulls-and-cows) repository.

# ‚û°Ô∏è How to try
Go to [Release page](https://github.com/danijcom/CowsAndBulls/releases), download the latest release and try it.

# ‚û°Ô∏è How to build
I used **Microsoft Visual Studio** environment for development.

You just need to **clone or download** my repository, create new blank VisualStudio C++ project and add all my **.cpp** and **.h** files as well as **assets** folder.

Then you need to **download SFML** (I used SFML v2.5.1) and add **configure your project** according to [this guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php).

**Thats all.** Now ensure that you have correct paths for all assets (Game.cpp file, line 90-110) and **build your project!**
